# Internship-Task1

# Task1
# Objective:

The objective of this repository is to showcase the tasks that I completed during my internship. These tasks focus on data analysis and visualization concepts using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and NumPy.

# Approach:

Loaded the dataset using pandas via df=pd.read_csv('filename').

Explored the dataset structure using:
 1) shape to view dimensions
 2) columns to list features
 3) head() to fetch Initial records/rows

Created visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn:
 1) Scatter Plot to analyze relationships between features
 2) Histogram to examine data distribution
 3) Box Plot to detect outliers and value spread

# Results & Insights:

1) Helped to understand the dataset better using visualizations
2) Scatter plots shows clear relationships between SepalLength and Sepalwidth features.
3) Histogram explained the data distribution clearly.
4) Box plot helped to identify data spread and outliers.
5) Improved understanding of data analysis and visualization techniques.
